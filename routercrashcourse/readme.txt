Routing concept:

BrowserRouter - We use this to place all the Route at once place. Generally it specified that it consists of all the routes

Route - It consists of the path where the route should redirect and also an component element to specify which component to redirect when it meets the path. We can specify a route in case we no path is mentioned then it will handle that scenario.

Switch - Switch component will render exact component when compared to Router. If there scenario where in which we have / and /home then both the component will get rendered but using switch we render first match.

Link - It is like adding rendering components to menubar and navbar
